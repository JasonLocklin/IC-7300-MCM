# Tmux config

Configure os to fast boot to tmux in a console with a configured session.

Configure tmux keybindings to universally run a few rigctl commands:
  * morse speed up/down
  * Direct frequency entry
  * Radio memories
  * Send morse letters (one by one with a buffer)
  * Toggle system services like the audio server or WFView Server.

Read radio state data into info bar using /tmp files provided by system service.

Load cluster, irc, logger, etc into buffers easily.
