# MCM case

This folder is for 3d print designs for a case that mounts a Raspberry Pi Zero to the back of 
the IC-7300.

A short USB OTG cable to USB type B cable is used to connect the RPi to the radio for CAT control.

A 12v to 5v DCDC converter + some filtering is used to draw power from either the ACC
port of the radio, or off the side of the power plug. 

The intent is to minimise any visible wiring, separate power leads, or extra boxes. It should
look like a part of the radio as much as possible.
